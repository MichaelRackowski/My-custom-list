In this method you have 2 generic custom lists that subract for each other. 
They subract one isntance of the cutsom list from antoher instance of a custom list.


 [TestMethod]
        public void Op_TwoIntLists_Compared()
        {
            CustomList<int> num = new CustomList<int>() { 7, 8, 9 };
            CustomList<int> numb = new CustomList<int>() { 7, 5, 6 };
            CustomList<int> expectedResult = new CustomList<int>() { 8, 9 };
            CustomList<int> actualReuslt;

            actualReuslt = num - numb;

            Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult.ToString(), actualReuslt.ToString());
        }
Here is an example the answer would be (8,9) and I'll expain why,
You compare the first list to the second, if they have the same number you get rid of that number.
You use the first list so if list Two doesn't have a number thats in the first list you get rid of that number.
You always return list One.
